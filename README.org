* Minimal SAMV71 Base Application
This serves as a basic application which can provides application level control of low level peripherals.

** Features
- Barebones initialization and startup code for the SAMV71.
- Integration with FreeRTOS for real-time task management.
- Example application showcasing basic peripheral usage.
- Support for open-source toolchains and workflows (e.g., GCC, OpenOCD, and GDB).
- No dependency on Microchip or IAR IDEs.
